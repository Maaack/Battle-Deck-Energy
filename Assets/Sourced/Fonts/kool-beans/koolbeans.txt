Thanks for downloading "Kool Beans" from Insanitype! Font Design.  This font is based on the Kool-Aid logo.  It kind of reminds me of a retro surf font or something.  I think it would work well for a logo.  All the brackets and parenthesis as well as the tilde (the squiggley thing at the top-left of your keyboard) are Kool-Aid Man dingbats.  Any other international characters produce a dingbat of yours truly.  If you use it, please let me know!

Feel free to use it all you want in any commercial or non-commercial projects including webpages, reports, etc.  If you feel so inclined, I would appreciate a $15 registration fee for commercial projects.  Hey, even if you don't use it in a commercial project, I'll take a donation.  For this, please contact me via e-mail.
