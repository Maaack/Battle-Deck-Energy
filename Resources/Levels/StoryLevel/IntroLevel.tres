You were born with more Battle Deck Energy than \"most\".
In the technical interpretation of \" > 50% + 1\".
Still, bullies have kept you down, fearful of one day being overthrown themselves.

Damage has been done, but you're onto their game.
Now you must battle to recover your self-confidence and topple the oppressors.

Tyrants are right to be afraid...
Their reign cannot last forever.
